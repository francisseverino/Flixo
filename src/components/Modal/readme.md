### Future improvements for the modal

- [ ] Close modal on typing ESC ⇒ Use useEffect to add a window.addEventListener for the keypress ESC. Don't forget to remove the event listener on effect cleanup!

- [ ] Close modal on tapping outside the modal ⇒ Use the useOnClickOutside hook or use the react-click-outside HOC.

- [ ]Manage the open/close state more cleanly ⇒ Perhaps replace the render props pattern with useContext to manage the open/close state.

- [ ]Make that dang close button look good
